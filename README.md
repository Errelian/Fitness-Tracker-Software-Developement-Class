# Fitness-Tracker-Software-Developement-Class
A simple OpenJFX based fitness tracker for my Software Developement Class.

The program stores data in JSON files, which it reads at startup, and represents them with built-in OpenJFX graphs.

The project's intended usage is tracking calories burned via various exercises, and of course, using to later look that data up.
